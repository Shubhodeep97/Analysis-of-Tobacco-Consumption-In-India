## Drscription

India is the second-largest consumer and producer of tobacco in the whole world (behind China). Nearly 330 million adults (15 years and above) in India (24% of all adults) consume tobacco in a daily basis, according to the NFHS Survey 2021. The most prevalent form of tobacco use in India is smokeless tobacco and commonly used products are khaini, gutkha, betel quid with tobacco, and zarda. Smoking forms of tobacco used are bidi, cigarette, and hookah.


In this project, I used the data from https://www.findeasy.in/tobacco-use-among-adults-in-india/ to get the information of consumption of tobacco among Male and Female in the whole Country and it shows the percentage consumption of male and female in each state of the nation. The whole result has been shown in a Dashboard visually using Power BI.
